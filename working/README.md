# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document
This SRS defines the objectives, functionalities, constraints, and performance requirements for a novel **NLP system** that:

- Stores factual knowledge in an **external (possibly peer-to-peer) database** rather than in the model parameters.
- Uses **quantum-inspired, diffusion-based transformations** of \(k\)-vectors for text encoding and decoding.
- Maintains a **small language model** specialized in grammar and syntax, while relying on an **external knowledge store** for factual accuracy.

The document is intended to guide the design, development, and validation of the system, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear, agreed-upon set of requirements.

### 1.2 Scope
- **System Name**: *Quantum-Inspired \(k\)-Vector NLP with External Knowledge Store*
- **System Domain**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Retrieval, with potential quantum computing integration.
- **Primary Goals**:
    1. Enable **accurate and up-to-date** factual information retrieval.
    2. Maintain **lightweight parametric** components for grammar and text generation.
    3. Provide **scalable** knowledge storage via a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** or distributed network.
    4. Utilize **diffusion** (noising and denoising) and **QFT/IQFT**-like operations on \(k\)-vectors to encode and decode language.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **\(k\)-Vector**: A multigrade geometric algebra vector encoding conceptual, relational, and attention-based components of text tokens.
- **QFT / IQFT**: Quantum Fourier Transform / Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform; used here in a quantum-inspired sense to decompose and reconstruct text from wavefunction-like states.
- **Diffusion**: A process that adds noise (forward diffusion) and learns to remove it (reverse diffusion) to refine representations.
- **P2P**: Peer-to-peer network architecture for distributed data storage and retrieval.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing.

1. Research on **Retrieval-Augmented Language Models** (e.g., RAG, RETRO).
2. Documentation on **Geometric Algebra** for computing \(k\)-vectors (e.g., `clifford` libraries).
3. Quantum computing frameworks (e.g., **Qiskit**, **Cirq**, **PennyLane**).

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This system diverges from monolithic large language models by separating **factual knowledge** (in a distributed store) from **linguistic competence** (in a smaller model). It introduces:

- **\(k\)-Vector Representations** for tokens and sentences.
- **Quantum-Inspired Operations** (QFT/IQFT) on superpositions of tokens.
- **Diffusion** for iterative denoising and emergent grammatical structure.
- **Peer-to-Peer Knowledge Store** for robust, decentralized factual updates.

### 2.2 Product Functions
1. **Token ↔ \(k\)-Vector Encoder**
    - Maps text tokens to \(k\)-vectors capturing conceptual and relational info.
    - Reconstructs tokens from \(k\)-vectors in the inverse direction.

2. **Diffusion Engine**
    - Introduces and removes noise on \(k\)-vectors to refine or discover linguistic structures.

3. **QFT/IQFT Module**
    - Decomposes sentence-level \(k\)-vectors into token constituents (QFT).
    - Reconstructs sentences (IQFT), introducing grammatical elements via interference patterns.

4. **P2P Knowledge Database**
    - Stores factual information and conceptual embeddings for retrieval.
    - Provides low-latency lookups through distributed caching or data sharding.

5. **Language Generation**
    - Uses refined \(k\)-vectors plus knowledge store data to produce coherent text.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **NLP Researchers**: Interested in advanced modeling, quantum computing integration, and geometric algebra approaches.
- **Developers / Engineers**: Build and deploy system components (tokenization, diffusion, knowledge store, etc.).
- **End Users**: Interact with the system via an API (Q&A, search). Unaware of quantum or geometric internals.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Hardware**:
    - Classical HPC clusters with GPU/TPU resources for diffusion and partial QFT emulations.
    - Optional quantum computers (NISQ devices or simulators) for experimental QFT/IQFT operations.
- **Software**:
    - Deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
    - Vector database solutions (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone) or custom GA-based indexing.
    - Container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for microservice deployment.

### 2.5 Constraints
- **High Dimensionality** of \(k\)-vectors may cause memory and computation overhead.
- **Latency** concerns in a P2P network require caching or partitioning strategies.
- **Quantum Hardware Availability** may be limited; quantum-inspired operations might initially be classical simulations.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system assumes **quality data ingestion** with minimal malicious or noisy data in the knowledge store.
- Dependencies on HPC/quantum libraries (Qiskit, Cirq) and GA libraries (`clifford` or custom) must be consistently maintained.
- The language model’s smaller parameter set assumes that **most factual lookups** are external.

## 4. Use Cases

    2. The system forms a \(k\)-vector query.
    3. Relevant knowledge shards are retrieved from the P2P store.
    4. The system applies diffusion (noising-denoising) to integrate the knowledge with the query’s \(k\)-vectors.
    5. IQFT reconstructs a coherent sentence: “George Washington was the first president of the United States.”
- **Success Condition**: The user receives a concise, accurate answer.

### 4.2 Use Case: Knowledge Update
- **Description**: A new fact, “The current president is X,” is added to the knowledge store.

    2. The updated knowledge becomes available to all peers.
    3. The language model is **not** retrained.
